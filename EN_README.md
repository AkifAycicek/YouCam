### Motivation

Unfortunately in OBS studio you cant see yourself while having your camera recorded. For that you need an extra application or a referrence monitor. This app was made  because of that extra application not existing and to try out NW.js

### Install

To run the app:

```
npm run start
```

To package the app:

```
npm run build
```

Packages can only be made with win64. For other packages you must configure.
